# Making my Mock E-commerce Store

Hello, thank you for viewing my readme file! I created a simple ecommerce store using react and firebase.

## What I Learned

React's Hooks and when/how to utilize them. Use Context was the most useful hook in the application as I ended up passing data around.

How to fetch data via REST API to my firebase realtime database.

Configured a way to import images into my application because each shoe is a part of a JSON object, and JSON cannot store image files.

## What I Will Update In The Future

I will the ability to 'order' shoes (Store orders in my database) using form and adding validation to it.

User authentication and the ability to look at order history
